# COINSTAC - Introduction
# Decentralized Analysis Made Easy

The Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC) is a tool developed to overcome barriers to collaboration through the use of federated analysis and standardization of collaboration methods. COINSTAC enables users to create collaborative consortia which and run decentralized computations against the data of consortia members in-place. The data is never moved or shared, and only group-level derivatives are passed back. This allows for large scale collaborative analysis between multiple sites without the technological, policy, and administrative challenges that come with centralized analysis.

Let's do research!

## Getting Started

Depending on how you plan to use COINSTAC you'll be looking for documentation in a few places:

- [End User/Researcher docs](./tutorial-basics)
  Documentation for users of the COINSTAC application. Contains useful tutorials on how to create consortia, create pipelines, run analyses, etc.
- [Computation Author docs](./tutorial-basics)
  Tutorials for creating computations and the api documentation for the computation spec for designing a UI interface for your computation.
- [Developer/Contributor docs](./tutorial-basics)
  Getting started documentation for developers and contributors to COINSTAC.
