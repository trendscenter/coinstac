COINSTAC enables users to create collaborative consortia which and run decentralized computations against the data of consortia members in-place. The data is never moved or shared, and only group-level derivatives are passed back. This allows for large scale collaborative analysis between multiple sites without the technological, policy, and administrative challenges that come with centralized analysis.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
