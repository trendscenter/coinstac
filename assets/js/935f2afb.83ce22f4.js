In this document, we will be diving deeper into the COINSTAC Compspec file (compspec.json), which is the main way we describe our computation to the COINSTAC UI. Generally speaking, the Compspec tells COINSTAC what Docker image to use, what the expected inputs are, and how to display the resulting output. Since we\'ve read the above Development Guide, we should know how to reference our Docker image, so let\'s talk about Inputs. By the end of this document, you should be able to understand how to design the UI for your computation by using the Compspec.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"computation-author/mount-and-map":{"id":"computation-author/mount-and-map","title":"Mount and Map","description":"Computations are designed to consume data mounted into the input directory of the computation container.

COINSTAC enables users to create collaborative consortia which and run decentralized computations against the data of consortia members in-place. The data is never moved or shared, and only group-level derivatives are passed back. This allows for large scale collaborative analysis between multiple sites without the technological, policy, and administrative challenges that come with centralized analysis.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
