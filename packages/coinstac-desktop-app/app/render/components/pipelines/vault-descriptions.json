  "TReNDS VBM Vault": "This vault contains data from 152 subjects, approximately half controls and half individuals with chronic schizophrenia, collected as part of the Mind Research Network COBRE study. The vault includes gray matter segmentation data from an SPM VBM preprocessing pipeline. In addition, we have demographic, symptom, and cognitive variables to select from in building a desired model.",
  "TReNDS COBRE FreeSurfer Vault": "This vault contains data from 152 subjects, approximately half controls and half individuals with chronic schizophrenia, collected as part of the Mind Research Network COBRE study (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017181). The vault includes cortical and sub-cortical volumetric and surface based measurements from two FreeSurfer atlases, Desikan-Killiany and Destrieux. In addition, we include demographic, symptom, and cognitive variables which can be used to build a desired model.",
  "CMI FreeSurfer Healthy Brain Network Vault": "CMI FreeSurfer Healthy Brain Network Vault and all gen-ec2-*CMI FreeSurfer Healthy Brain Network Vault. This vault contains data from 885 children and adolescents (ages 5 - 21), collected as part of the Healthy Brain Network study (REF). The vault includes brain volumes from Desikan Killiany FreeSurfer atlas. In addition, we have demographic, cognitive, and substance use variables to select from when building a desired model.",
  "CMI VBM Vault": "This Vault contains data from 922 children and adolescents (ages 6 - 22, 603 Male and 319 female), collected as part of the Healthy Brain Network study. The Vault includes gray matter segmentated data from a VBM preprocessing pipeline. In addition, we have a total of 11 variables across demographic, cognitive and substance use to select from when building a desired regression model.",
  "TReNDS GICA VAULT": "Group ICA is one of the frequently used preprocessing computations for neuroimaging data. Data preprocessed with group ICA can be used to perform different types of analyses. This GICA Vault comprises data from 189 subjects from the COBRE project analyzed with Neuromark template which uses 66 predefined ROIs. This Vault data includes independent component analysis(ICA) maps, Functional network connectivity maps (FNC) data etc. that have been generated using spatially constrained ICA with the neuromark fMRI 1.0 template (available in the GIFT software) including 53 intrinsic network components. This Vault data can be readily used for secondary analysis like MANCOVA. Presently, we use the GICA pre-processed data from the Vault to perform univariate regression analysis."
