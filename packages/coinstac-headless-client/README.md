# COINSTAC Headless Client

The headless client allows a static dataset(s) to be made available to the larger COINSTAC ecosystem, giving the ability for others to run pipelines using your data without it ever leaving your system

## Setup
### System Requirements
 * [a Nodejs LTS installation](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Installation
 * to install `npm i -g coinstac-headless-client`
 * to run `coinstac-headless-client`

### Application Requirements
 * The headless client will need access to docker, best done by adding the user running the client to the `docker` group
 * read access to the filesystem where the data is kept
 * outgoing traffic on port `80` via the `MQTT` protocol, though the client will fallback to WS HTTP if unavailable
 * outgoing traffic for HTTPS on port `443`


How the headless client is run will be system dependent, we recommend Upstart for systems that have that
available

To run the client you'll need to set the following environment variables. These will either reference a self managed COINSTAC system, or the TReNDs system found [here](../coinstac-ui/config/local-production.json).

If running in the TReNDs system, contact the TReNDs team for an application username, api key, and to setup computation specific whitelists and compspec locations.
